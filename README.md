# Find similar images

Find similar images from your local machine using deep learning

Use "help/env.txt" to build the environment. (find run command inside)

I have used Pytorch `resnet18` pre-trained model for extracting features from image.

Similarity is found using cosine similarity between query image and images from our pc (imagedb)
