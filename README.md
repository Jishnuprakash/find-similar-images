# reverse_image_search
Find similar images from your local machine using deep learning

I have used Pytorch resnet18 pre-trained model for extracting features from image.

Similarity is found using cosine similarity between query image and images from our pc (imagedb)

![Query Image]('https://github.com/Jishnuprakash/reverse_image_search/blob/main/query.png')
![Results]('https://github.com/Jishnuprakash/reverse_image_search/blob/main/results.png')
